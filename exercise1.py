# # Exercise 1/3: Tracking by detection and simple frame-by-frame matching
#
# You could also run this notebook on your laptop, a GPU is not needed.
#
# Here we will walk through all basic components of a tracking-by-detection algorithm.
#
# You will learn
# - to **store and visualize** tracking results with `napari` (Exercise 1.1).
# - to use a robust pretrained deep-learning-based **object detection** algorithm called *StarDist* (Exercise 1.2).
# - to implement a basic **nearest-neighbor linking algorithm** (Exercises 1.3 - 1.6).
# - to compute optimal frame-by-frame linking by setting up a **bipartite matching problem** and using a python-based solver (Exercise 1.7).
# - to compute suitable object **features** for the object linking process with `scikit-image` (Exercise 1.8).
#
# Places where you are expected to write code are marked with ```YOUR CODE HERE```.

# - When you are coding and debugging, close the napari viewer with `viewer.close()` to avoid problems with the two event loops of napari and jupyter.

# The detections in each frame now need to be linked in time to form tracks. In the following exercises, we will explore different ways of doing this.

# We will start with the simplest algorithm: We take a pair of adjacent frames and compute a distance function between each detection $p \in P$ in frame $t$ and each detection $q \in Q$ in frame $t+1$. For example, we can calculate the euclidian distance between the two centroids of detections. This can be written as a matrix of size $|P| \times |Q|$.

# ## Optimal frame-by-frame matching (*Linear assignment problem* or *Weighted bipartite matching*)

# %% [markdown]
# The nearest neighbor algorithm above will not pick the best solution in many cases. For example, it does not consider the local arrangement of a few detections to create links, something which the human visual system is very good at.
#
# We need a better optimization algorithm to minimize the total minimal linking distance between two frames. To use a classic and efficient optimization algorithm, we will represent this linking problem as a bipartite graph. Here is an example:
#
# <img src="figures/bipartite_graph.png" width="300"/>
#
# Red vertices correspond to detections in frame $t$, blue vertices to detections in frame $t+1$. Since we know that we don't want to link a detection to another one from the same frame, possible edges only connect blue vertices to red vertices, but not within each set.
#
# We can also put weights on the edges, which correspond the distanes we have calculated. The task is now to prune the edges of this graph such that each vertex has at most one incident edge. This is called a *weighted bipartite matching* or *linear assignment problem (LAP)*.

# %% [markdown]
# In the seminal tracking algorithm proposed by Jaqaman et al. (2008), the bipartite matching additionally includes cost for not linking a vertex. An unlinked vertex from frame $t$ corresponds to the death of a cell, an unlinked vertex from frame $t+1$ to the birth of a cell. Here is the cost matrix in detail:
